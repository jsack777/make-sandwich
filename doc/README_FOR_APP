The Make Sandwich App:
  This application will create a sandwich order to be sent to the GT sandwich collection mailbox

  It defaults to using SSL for all interaction for a more secure session
  It uses the devise gem for User account creation and maintenance
  Bootstrap styles have been utilized
  Rspec and cucumber were used to test basic functionality in the app

  The basic workflow (this feature can be found in features/create_order.feature):
    User logs in or signs up with an account and logs in - not tested
    Presented with a Welcome screen, the user has just created an order session
    The User then adds sandwich(es) to the current order
    When finished adding sandwiches, the user then submits the order
    The user receives an email confirmation and a copy is sent to the GT sandwich currier
    The user can browse previous orders, but at this time can not perform much more than that
